                    I know this doesn't sound like much of an interest, but hear me out.
                    <br>
                    I'm a frequent member of online music communities like <a href="https://rateyourmusic.com/">Rate Your Music</a>, where I review newly released albums, 
                    or classics that I haven't gotten around to yet. Online forums are also where
                    I find my next listen!
                    <br>
                    I also hold a weekly radio show on 91.5 FM, WMFO, Tufts Freeform Radio, with my good friend. We take deep dives
                    into overlooked emotions, and play music that we think reflects the feelings associated with that emotion.
                    Listen in to <a href="https://www.wmfo.org/">'Affective Meltdown'</a> every Wednesday at 6 AM!

            <div class="slidingElement">
                <p>
                    A passion for running 'runs' in the family, as my father competed collegiately in track and field,
                    and my mother is a multi-time marathoner, and still runs marathons to this day! Beyond this, both 
                    of my brothers ran in high school. This influenced me to start running competitively before I reached
                    middle school, and I haven't looked back since! 
                    <br>
                    Currently, I compete for <a href="https://gotuftsjumbos.com/sports/mens-cross-country">Tufts University's varsity cross country and track and field teams</a>. My
                    experiences competing for a collegiate team have provided me with memories that I will never 
                    forget, and teammates that I will hold dear to me for the rest of my life.

                <p> 
                    I'm very fortunate that two interests of mine complement each other, as my love of running allows me to explore the great outdoors!
                    <br>
                    As I grow older, I find that my appreciation of everything outside my bedroom grows, and I get to share this
                    sentiment with my friends through the trips we take together! This past summer we spent a week in Acadia National Park,
                    and it was the trip of a lifetime! I'll never forget the view at the top of Cadillac Mountain.
                    <br>
                    I also enjoy visiting my cousins in the Coloradan Rockies, and getting to explore all that the low-elevation dwellers (like myself) are barred from!
